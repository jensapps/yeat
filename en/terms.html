        <h4>Article 3. Intellectual property and copyright</h4>
          <p>Yeatapp® and Yeat® are registered trademarks of Niche nv. These terms and graphic elements, such as logos specific to them, may only be used in reference to solutions and websites of Niche nv. </p>
          <p>Company address details are either posted by the companies themselves or included in the selection by Yeat / Yeatapp and collected through public data sources such as Google and therefore not owned by Yeat / Yeatapp. We consider additional data published by (such as description, photos) and about companies (such as reviews) as the property of the restaurant owners themselves. This data may therefore only be used with the express permission of the company in question.</p>
        <h4>Article 4. Booking </h4>
          <p>A user who books an available table via the app is bound by the usual etiquette that applies when booking a restaurant. This means respecting the number of people the user has booked for, respecting the time and time slot at which the reservation was made, respecting the restaurant's regulations regarding specific points specific to the restaurant, such as pets not allowed or table on the first floor, or on the terrace, etc.</p>
          <p>The restaurant owner must clearly state these regulations when making his table available so that the user can take note of them in advance.A user who books a table is bound to effectively occupy this table with the number of persons stated. Changes to his booking can only be submitted in advance by telephone to the restaurant manager.</p>
        <h4>Article 5. Cancellation of a reservation</h4>
          <p>It is up to the user to cancel a reservation correctly. This is not possible via the app. Given the "very last minute" nature of the app, the user who has booked and wants to cancel again should contact the restaurant by telephone.</p>
          <p>The user acknowledges that only telephone cancellation is accepted as valid cancellation. The restaurant manager will confirm the cancellation by email.</p>
          <p>Every user of the application agrees that a restaurant owner could charge him compensation for not (correctly) canceling a booked reservation. If a claim for damages is not made, it will be entirely for the restaurant operator's account.</p>
          <p>Yeat / Yeatapp cannot be held responsible for actions by users or restaurant managers with regard to cancellations of confirmed bookings.</p>
        <h4>Article 6. Evidence and applicable law</h4>
          <p>Belgian law applies. The parties accept that the electronic communication between them has legal force of written proof. In case of disputes or disputes, only the courts of Bruges are competent.</p>
          <p>Niche nv aims with Yeat / Yeatapp and yeatapp.com to develop a user-friendly online platform where the users have full control over, and access to their own data and he / she only receives the information that he / she has explicitly asked for.</p>
          <p>If you experience in a certain way as a user that this objective is not being met, we ask you to formulate your complaint to claim@yeatapp.com</p>
